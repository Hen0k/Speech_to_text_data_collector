## Introduction

 The aim of this project is to produce a tool that can be deployed to process posting and receiving text and audio files from and into a data lake, apply transformation in a distributed manner, and load it into a warehouse in a suitable format to train a speech-to-text model. 

## Pipeline
  This is our pipeline of this project that will be used to record millions of Amharic and Swahili speakers reading digital texts in-app and web platforms.
